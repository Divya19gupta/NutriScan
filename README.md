# NutriScan: An NFC Enabled Salad Counter

## Summary

NutriScan is an innovative project designed to promote healthier eating habits by providing real-time nutritional information about salad ingredients. The system combines NFC (Near Field Communication) technology with an Arduino-based setup to create a user-friendly salad counter that evaluates the healthiness of selected ingredients.

## Features

- **NFC-enabled Scanning**: Users can scan ingredients embedded with NFC tags to instantly receive nutritional information.
- **Real-time Health Analysis**: The system calculates and displays the nutritional value of the salad based on the selected ingredients.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface ensures that users can easily interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **NFC Technology**: For scanning and identifying ingredients.
- **Arduino Platform**: For processing the data and interfacing with the NFC modules.
- **Nutritional Database**: A backend database that stores and provides nutritional information for various ingredients.

## How to Use

1. **Scan the Ingredients**: Place an ingredient with an NFC tag near the scanner.
2. **View Nutritional Information**: The system will display the nutritional details of the scanned ingredient.
3. **Analyze Your Salad**: Combine multiple ingredients to get an overall nutritional profile of your salad.

## Future Work

- Integration with mobile apps for personalized diet tracking.
- Expansion of the nutritional database to include more ingredients.
